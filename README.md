## Welcome to my Work-Day-Scheduler!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to use the functions of day.js and manipulate it.</li> 
    <li>I learned how to easily apply a setInterval to a function to make it seem like a live update clock</li>
    <li>I learned how to target specific elements using .parent .child . sibiling as well as jquery 'this'</li>
    
</ul>

## Functions of my App
<ul>
    <li>This app will load the Day, Month, date number, Year and current Time.</li>
    <li>It will then refresh the time every second.</li>
    <li>It will then use that time to color code each hour block to be grey(past),green(future) or red(present).</li>
    <li>The user can then input text content into the blank fields and click the save button</li>
    <li>The save button will then store the text content to local storage</li>
    <li>On page reload or refresh, local storage will be recalled into the text content fields</li>
</ul>

## Future improvements/updates
<ul>
    <li>Currently the app doesnt seem to change the color boxes when the hour rolls over, the page must be reloaded.</li>
    <li>I would like for the app to change the boxes dynamically when the hour rolls over.</li>
    <li>Possibly in the future I would like the convert this from being a singular day scheduler to being a part of an weekly/monthly planner.</li>
